This UI is based on the following example https://github.com/run-llama/create_llama_projects/tree/main/nextjs-multi-modal.

## Introduction

The UI has been enhanced with the ability to record audio, choose your preferred language, and add a team logo. In addition, the API handling has been completely redesigned to be compatible with the use of locally hosted models instead of using the GPT4 version that was used in the original example. The image handling and displaying was also changed as it didn't work as is.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
